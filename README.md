# Notice

Apologies I should have updatged this a while back but :squirrel: 

Esoterical has a much more up-to date guide which I'd suggest any users of this guide refer to, this guide still "works" but klipper/canboot etc have moved on a fair amount in the past two years so some of the options/settings are no longer correctly references in this guide.
