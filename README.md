# Notice

Apologies I should have updated this a while back but :squirrel: 

Esoterical has a much more up-to date guide which I'd suggest any users of this guide refer to.
So while this guide still "works" klipper/canboot have both moved on a fair amount in the past two years so some of the options/settings are no longer correctly referenced in this guide.
