# systemd-networkd 

Is a newer networking system daemon used by Debian and Ubuntu amongst others
At this time its not known if/when the raspbian stack will move to this standard.


## Am I using systemd-networkd


You can check by running the following.

`sudo systemctl status systemd-networkd`

If you see the following then you can leave this page :)

otherwise continue

### Check your version of systemd supports CAN interfaces

Run 
```bash
systemctl --version
```

If it reports a systemd version number of 239 or higher you are fine to continue.


### creating a CAN network for systemd-networkd

Run 
```bash
ls /etc/systemd/network/
```

If you see `80-can.network` check its blank before you blindly overwrite anything (its probably blank)

Running the below will open the existing file for editing, OR if none exist it will create a new file.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/80-can.network
```

Populate the file

```ini
[Match]
Name=can0

[Network]
BitRate=1000000
```

and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to save. (You can overwrite)

### Create a CAN link for systemd-networkd

Next up we can create a .link file which will allow setting of the txqueuelen and network type.

Again we can run the below to create an empty file.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/80-can.link
``` 

Populate the file

```ini
[Match]
Type=can

[Link]
TransmitQueueLength=256
```

and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to save. (You can overwrite)


### Restarting the network stack

The following commands will restart the stack incoporating your new network settings

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
```

You can check the status after with

```bash
sudo systemctl status systemd-networkd
```



#### Bringing the network online.

Note: this step may be suplurfious depending on your order of operations.

Ensure your USB CAN adapter is connected and visible via **`lsusb`**

It will present with an id of **`1d50:606f`** for most Candlelight_Fw devices, but may present differently if you have SLCAN firmware.


check if the network is up

```bash
ip -details link show can0
```

If you see a warning about the device not existing you need to check that your OS is seeing the device.


If you dont see a network but your USB device is connected and visible, run the following to force the nework up.

```bash
sudo networkctl up can0
```


Double check the network came up

```bash
ip -details link show can0
```

A good network will look like this (for now)

```console
can0: <NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 10
    link/can  promiscuity 0 minmtu 0 maxmtu 0 
    can state ERROR-ACTIVE restart-ms 0 
          bitrate 500000 sample-point 0.875 
          tq 125 prop-seg 6 phase-seg1 7 phase-seg2 2 sjw 1
          gs_usb: tseg1 1..16 tseg2 1..8 sjw 1..4 brp 1..1024 brp-inc 1
          clock 48000000 numtxqueues 1 numrxqueues 1 gso_max_size 65536 gso_max_segs 65535 parentbus usb parentdev 1-2:1.0
```

### Transmit queue length through udev (optional)

The transmit queue length setting isn't available in all systemd-networkd versions. If the transmit queue length isn't applied from your networkd configuration you can set up transmit queue length through udev instead.

To verify that your queue length value has been applied, you can run:
```bash
ip link show can0
```

The queue length is the value after qlen. In this example queue length is 10 instead of the expected 256:
```console
can0: <NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 10
    link/can  promiscuity 0 minmtu 0 maxmtu 0 
```

To fix this add a udev rule:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-can.link
```

Enter the contents:
```ini
# set tx queue size for canbus
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="can0" ATTR{tx_queue_len}="256"
```

and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to save. (You can overwrite)

Finally you need to restart the system.
